You are **very close**, but there is one small, important distinction between **Queries** and **Mutations** in RTK Query.

RTK Query returns different things depending on whether you are **getting** data or **changing** data.

---

### 1. Mutations (Changing Data) — Returns an Array

You are **correct** for **Mutations** (like `login`, `addProduct`, `deleteItem`). These return an array because you need a "trigger" function to start the action.

```javascript
// [triggerFunction, resultObject]
const [login, { isLoading, isError, data }] = useAdminLoginMutation();

```

* **Index 0:** The function you call (e.g., `login({ email, password })`).
* **Index 1:** An object containing the status of **that specific request**.

---

### 2. Queries (Getting Data) — Returns an Object

For **Queries** (like `useGetInventoryQuery`), it does **not** return an array. It returns a single **object**. This is because Queries run automatically as soon as the component mounts.

```javascript
// { resultObject }
const { data, isLoading, isError, error } = useGetInventoryQuery();

```

* There is no "trigger function" in the first position because the hook manages the fetching lifecycle for you.

---

### Comparison Table

| Feature | Hook Type | Returns | Example Usage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Mutation** | `useAdminLoginMutation` | **Array** `[fn, state]` | `const [add] = useAddMutation()` |
| **Query** | `useGetInventoryQuery` | **Object** `{ state }` | `const { data } = useGetQuery()` |

---

### 3. Why the difference?

* **Queries** are "Declarative." You are saying: "I want the inventory data to be here." The hook ensures it stays synced.
* **Mutations** are "Imperative." You are saying: "Only do this action when I click this specific button." Therefore, it gives you the function to call manually.

---

### One Pro-Tip: The `.unwrap()`

When you use a Mutation trigger, it returns a "thunk" (a promise). If you want to use a `try/catch` block in your component, you use `.unwrap()`:

```javascript
try {
  const payload = await login(credentials).unwrap();
  console.log('Success!', payload);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed!', error);
}

```

**Does the difference between the Array (Mutation) and the Object (Query) make sense now? Shall we try to build the User Cart logic using these hooks?**
